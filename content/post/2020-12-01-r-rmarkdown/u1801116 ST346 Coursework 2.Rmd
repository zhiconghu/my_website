```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# 1(a)

Load data courseworkData2.rda.

```{r}
library(here)
load(here::here("data","courseworkData2.rda"))
```

Fit a null and max Poisson regression model with total number of damage incidents as the outcome. Then, based on AIC, find the best model and look at the model.

```{r eval=FALSE}
glm.out1 <- glm(incidents ~ 1 + offset(log(service)), family=poisson(), 
                data=ships)
glm.out2 <- glm(incidents ~ (type + year + period)^2 + offset(log(service)), 
                family=poisson(), data=ships)
step(glm.out1, direction="both", 
     scope=list("lower"=glm.out1, "upper"=glm.out2))
glm.out3 <- glm(incidents ~ year + type + period + year:type + 
                offset(log(service)), family=poisson(), 
                data=ships)
summary(glm.out3)
```

However, this model is clearly inappropriate. Based on AIC, we look at the next best model.

```{r}
glm.out4 <- glm(incidents ~ year + type + period + offset(log(service)), 
                family=poisson(), data=ships)
summary(glm.out4)
```

Hence, glm.out4 is our final model.

# 1(b)

Look at the summary of the model, we can see that a ship of type E, constructed on year 1970 to year 1974 and have period of operation between 1975 to 1979 have the highest risk of damage.

# 1(c)

Extracting coefficients from the summary of the model glm.out4.

```{r}
expected = exp(summary(glm.out4)$coefficients["(Intercept)","Estimate"] + 
               summary(glm.out4)$coefficients["typeE","Estimate"] + 
               summary(glm.out4)$coefficients["year1970-74","Estimate"] +
               summary(glm.out4)$coefficients["period1975-79","Estimate"])*
  3353*(1/5)
expected
```

The expected number of damage incidents in twelve months for the class of shipping at 1(b) is ``r expected``.

# 2(a)

**Exponential Dispersion Model**: Binomial

**Link function**: Logit

**Outcome variable**: Number of school leavers who have a place at university or other higher education institute divided by total number of school leavers

**Predictor variable**: age, gender and smoking status

# 2(b)

**Exponential Dispersion Model**: Normal

**Link function**: Identity

**Outcome variable**: change in weights of individual rats after six month separated in two groups

**Predictor variable**: vitamin D intake in factor

# 2(c)

**Exponential Dispersion Model**: Poisson

**Link function**: Log

**Outcome variable**: log of number of times of break downs divided by number of miles driven

**Predictor variable**: model of the vehicle and number of times that it has been serviced

# 3(a)

Add a new column in the data frame that represents the total number of participants for each group.

```{r}
esoph$participants <- esoph$ncases + esoph$ncontrols
```

Fit a null and max Binomial regression model with percentage of participants with esophageal cancer as the outcome. Then, based on AIC, find the best model.

```{r warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
glm.out5 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ 1, family=binomial(), 
                weight=participants,data=esoph)
glm.out6 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ (agegp + alcgp + tobgp)^2, 
                family=binomial(), weight=participants, data=esoph)
step(glm.out5, direction="both", 
     scope=list("lower"=glm.out5, "upper"=glm.out6))
```

We now look at the model.

```{r}
glm.out7 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ alcgp + agegp + tobgp, 
                family=binomial(), weight=participants, 
                data=esoph)
summary(glm.out7)
```

Hence, glm.out7 is our best model.

# 3(b)

```{r}
glm.out8 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ as.numeric(alcgp) + agegp + tobgp, 
                family=binomial(), weight=participants, data=esoph)
anova(glm.out8, glm.out5, "LRT")

glm.out9 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ alcgp + as.numeric(agegp) + tobgp, 
                family=binomial(), weight=participants, data=esoph)
anova(glm.out9, glm.out5, "LRT")

glm.out10 <- glm(ncases/participants ~ alcgp + agegp + as.numeric(tobgp), 
                 family=binomial(), weight=participants, data=esoph)
anova(glm.out10, glm.out5, "LRT")

summary(glm.out10)
```

From the ANOVA tables, we can see that the p-value for `glm.out10` is 0.17, this means that there is no evidence to reject `glm.out10` from the null model. The variable `tobgp` should be a numeric value.

# 3(c)

```{r}
odds_ratio = exp(summary(glm.out10)$coefficients["alcgp120+","Estimate"])
odds_ratio
```

The odds ratio of esophageal cancer for a participant who drinks more than 120g of alcohol/day compared with one who drinks less than 40g of alcohol per day is ``r odds_ratio``.
