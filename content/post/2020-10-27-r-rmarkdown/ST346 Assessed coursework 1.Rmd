```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1(a)

Load data courseworkData1.rda, then fit a null Poisson regression model with number of claims as the outcome and name it `glm.out1`.

```{r 1a}
library(here)
load(here::here("data","courseworkData1.rda"))
glm.out1 = glm(formula = y ~ 1 + offset(log(n)), family = "poisson", data = insurance)
glm.out1
```

As we can see from the summary of `glm.out1`, the intercept of the model is -2.00326, now check it with equation.

```{r checkintercept}
intercept = log(sum(insurance$y)/sum(insurance$n))
intercept
```

The equation also equals to -2.00326.

## 1(b)

Fit a Poisson regression model with predictor variables `car`, `age`, `district`.

```{r 1b}
glm.out2 = glm(formula = y ~ factor(car) + factor(age) + district + offset(log(n)), family = "poisson", data = insurance)
modelsum <- summary(glm.out2)
exp(modelsum$coefficients["district","Estimate"])
```

An estimate of the rate ratio is ``r exp(modelsum$coefficients["district","Estimate"])``, the rate of insurance claims is higher in urban areas than rural areas.

## 1(c)

```{r 1c, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
glm.max = glm(formula = y ~ (factor(car) + factor(age) + district + offset(log(n)))^2, family = "poisson", data = insurance)
step(glm.max, direction = "both")
```

As we shown from the results, AIC is minimal at 208.07 when model is the same as the one in 1(b), therefore the maximal model is the one shown in 1(b).

## 1(d)

```{r 1d}
glm.out3 = glm(formula = y ~ factor(car) + age + district + offset(log(n)), family = "poisson", data = insurance)
anovatable = anova(glm.out2, glm.out3, test = "LRT")
anovatable
```

As Pr(>Chi) is ``r anovatable$"Pr(>Chi)"[2]``, according to 0.05 level of significance, there are no significant differences between the two model.

## 1(e)

The used model is `glm.out3`.

```{r 1e}
summary(glm.out3)
exp(summary(glm.out3)$coefficients["factor(car)4","Estimate"])
```

Therefore, the new insurance premium is ``r exp(summary(glm.out3)$coefficients["factor(car)4","Estimate"])``.

## 2(a)

```{r 2a, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
glm.out4 = glm(deaths ~ smoking + offset(log(personyears)), 
               family = "poisson", data = doctors)
summary(glm.out4)
smoker = filter(doctors, smoking == 1)
nosmoker = filter(doctors, smoking == 0)
lambda1 = sum(smoker$deaths)/sum(smoker$personyears)
lambda0 = sum(nosmoker$deaths)/sum(nosmoker$personyears)
log(lambda1/lambda0)
```

As we can see, the value is the same as the estimate of coefficient for smoking.

## 2(b)

```{r 2b}
glm.out5 = glm(deaths ~ factor(age) + smoking + offset(log(personyears)), 
               family = "poisson", data = doctors)
summary(glm.out5)$coefficients["smoking","Estimate"]
```

The estimate of $\beta$ drops to ``r summary(glm.out5)$coefficients["smoking","Estimate"]``.

## 2(c)

Shown from the two diagrams, the model in 2b is clearly not appropriate as there is a relationship between age and smoking. Using stratified parameterization for the new model.

```{r 2c}
glm.out6 = glm(deaths ~ (factor(age)/factor(smoking)) + offset(log(personyears)), 
               family = "poisson", data = doctors)
summary(glm.out6)
exp(summary(glm.out6)$coefficients["factor(age)65 to 74:factor(smoking)1","Estimate"])
```

The mortality rate ratio is ``r exp(summary(glm.out6)$coefficients["factor(age)65 to 74:factor(smoking)1","Estimate"])`` and p-value is ``r summary(glm.out6)$coefficients["factor(age)65 to 74:factor(smoking)1","Pr(>|z|)"]``.
